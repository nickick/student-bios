###Bio

Spent the last 3 years at Google as a Product Marketing Manager bringing new products to market, most recently on the Android / Nexus team. Studied Finance at Wharton (undergrad), and spent my summers on Wall Street before realizing tech was where I belonged.

I loved working at Google. Being surrounded by incredible engineers and product managers building some seriously epic things made me want to create as well. So I joined App Academy to learn as much as I can as fast as I can. It’s been an awesome 9 weeks. I want to keep creating, keep building, keep improving and keep this journey going.
