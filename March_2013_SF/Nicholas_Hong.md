###Bio

Hacking makes me happy. Nothing makes me smile like building out beautiful, intuitive web apps. I enjoy every part of the process, from watching a backend feature snap in place to setting box-shadows and transitions in CSS.

I studied Management and Biology at MIT. From there I spent time as a management consultant at Boston Consulting Group, leading a parking technology company near Duke University, and co-founding a SAT startup. Fun fact: I may be the only MIT graduate to have participated in a MMA cagefight.

My goal: join a fast-paced company to hit the ground running, work balls-to-the-wall, and learn as quickly as I can. I'd love to work full stack with a focused team on a great idea. Please contact me if you know a place!



###Capstone Project

[success-track.io](http://success-track-io.herokuapp.com)

Goal tracker app. Single page app heavily using Backbone.js and Backbone Relational plugin, with Ruby on Rails backend. Focus on usability and design.

[JH Fashion storefront](http://jh-fashion.herokuapp.com)

Basic CMS and storefront for my parents' store. Uses Rails, Filepicker and Backbone.js. It's built primarily to give users easy control and generation of storefront banner, products and images.  To see the backend click "admin" in upper right and use username: visitor@test.com and pw: password. Sign in and play with Filepicker integration to see banners/product display at front change.
